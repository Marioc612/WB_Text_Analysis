REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

1

Introduction
Progress towards gender equality is key to meeting global goals of eradicating poverty and
eliminating hunger and malnutrition. Women make important contributions to agriculture
and rural livelihoods and play a vital role in the care and reproduction of households and
communities. However, persistent gender inequalities, such as unequal access to productive
resources – including land, services and inputs, finance, training – and information to markets
and institutions hamper the realization of women’s human and productive potential. These
inequalities must be addressed to realize the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the
mandate of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to eliminate
hunger and malnutrition and eradicate poverty through sustainable agriculture and management
of natural resources.
In recent years, the United Nations (UN) and FAO have deepened their institutional commitment
to gender equality. In 2006 the UN Chief Executive Board for Coordination endorsed the UN
System-Wide Action Plan to speed inclusion of gender equality and women’s empowerment
throughout the UN system. FAO formulated the FAO Gender Equality Policy (GEP) in 2012,
establishing institutional targets and external objectives for gender equality in rural
development, agriculture and resource management (FAO, 2013a). To support the
implementation of the FAO GEP and ensure attention to gender equality and women’s
empowerment in all its areas of work, FAO also strengthened its gender architecture
consisting of a team of experts at headquarters, regional gender advisors and Gender
Focal Points (GFP) in country offices.Gender is a cross-cutting theme in the FAO Strategic
Framework and its five Strategic Objectives.1 This confirms the organization’s commitment
to “pursue the integration of gender issues in all aspects of its work, ensuring that attention
to gender equality becomes a regular feature of work on standard setting and of regional,
subregional and country level programmes and projects” (FAO, 2013b, 20).
In the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, gender equality is mainstreamed as well as
being included as a stand-alone Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) (SDG5), which aims at
gender equality, including in representation and decision-making and in access to economic
resources, inheritance, and natural resources.2 FAO further recognizes rural women as
agents of change whose engagement is necessary to meet the other SDGs (FAO, 2015). This
Regional Gender Strategy and Action Plan 2017–2019 for the FAO Regional Office for Asia
and the Pacific (RAP) builds on and supports these efforts.

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

Objectives and process
The Regional Gender Strategy aims to provide focus for the FAO gender-related
work in Asia and the Pacific and identify delivery mechanisms for the period 2017–2019. The
main objectives of the strategy are to: 1) establish regional priorities to support gender equality
in alignment with the FAO GEP and Strategic Framework; 2) outline delivery mechanisms, roles
and responsibilities; and 3) improve the visibility of RAP’s gender work and encourage knowledge
generation and the sharing of results.
The regional strategy encompasses work at both the regional, and country level. Because
the agricultural, socioeconomic, and gender contexts in the Asia-Pacific Region are so
diverse, the strategy does not attempt to map out all gender work that will take place in all
countries and technical areas. Rather, it maps out areas of common focus to which many
countries in the region can contribute. Individual countries and technical teams will need to
assess their situation and develop specific activities to meet local needs and opportunities
within the context of the GEP and the Regional Strategy. The Strategy is also specific to the
time period at hand: it focuses on what needs to be done in the next four years to move
RAP towards the FAO longer-term gender equality goals and ultimately the achievement
of the SDGs.
Process: The Strategy was developed with feedback and input from regional and country
office staff and headquarters, and endorsed by the Assistant Director-General and Regional
Representative (ADG/RR) for Asia and the Pacific. Initial drafts were prepared by a consultant
in collaboration with the Regional Gender Officer, drawing on: 1) review of the GEP and other
global FAO documents on gender; 2) the Regional Gender Stocktaking report, including a survey
of government counterparts conducted for the stocktaking; 3) the Regional Gender Workshop
report (FAO, 2015); and 4) the outcomes of the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference (APRC)3,
regional initiatives concept notes, and other regional documents.
Audience: The Gender Strategy is intended primarily for RAP, country offices, and project staff. It
will identify areas where specific programmes can support the gender objectives, outlining roles
and responsibilities. For regional partners, the strategy will provide a clear understanding of the
FAO strategic priorities and planned work on gender throughout the region in the medium term.
Timeframe: The duration of the strategy is four years and will be reviewed at midpoint and
adjusted if necessary. Supporting gender equality is an ongoing process to which different
countries and technical areas may contribute with a variety of efforts and at their own pace.

Regional context and priorities
1. Regional gender context
Women make essential contributions to agriculture across Asia and the Pacific, comprising
between 40 and 50 percent of the agricultural labour force in East and Southeast Asia and
around 30 percent in South Asia. In China and India, women make up one fifth of fishers
and one fourth of fish farmers and they are responsible for marketing up to 60 percent of all
seafood (FAO, 2012). In Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, women provide up to half of
the total labour in rice production (CGIAR, 1995). Agriculture is also the primary provider of
employment for women in the region. In South Asia, agriculture engages close to 70 percent
of all working women (FAO, 2011a).
Despite contributing significantly to the rural economy, women face multiple gender-related
constraints and inequalities, such as unequal access to land and productive inputs as well as
unequal participation in personal, family, and community decision-making. Women represent
on average only 10 percent of all agricultural landholders in Asia (FAO, 2016a). The average
landholdings of male-headed households are more than twice the size of those of femaleheaded households in Bangladesh and Pakistan (FAO, 2011b). According to the Women’s
Empowerment in Agriculture Index, unequal access to group membership and lack of
decision-making power on use of income and autonomy in production pose the biggest
constraints on women’s empowerment in Bangladesh and Nepal (IFPRI, 2014).4
The RAP Regional Gender Workshop was held in 20155 bringing together FAO GFPs, Government
Gender Focal Points (GGFP) and representatives from civil society and farmers’ organizations.
The Workshop highlighted the ways that social and traditional norms, culture and institutions,
governing frameworks and markets explicitly or implicitly constrain women in Asia and the
Pacific. It identified the following areas where work is needed to advance gender equality,
including:
•
•
		
•
		
•

Increasing understanding of gender context;
Capacity development on gender that addresses existing gender inequalities by
increasing women’s access to and control over resources and markets;
Increasing the voice of women and their participation in rural
institutions and decision-making bodies; and
Building partnerships and awareness.

2. Emerging regional trends and challenges
The agricultural context in Asia and the Pacific is diverse and undergoing rapid transformation,
with increasing competition over land use and decreasing natural resource availability. RAP has
identified several emerging regional trends which affect agriculture, food security and natural
resource management in the region and hence RAP’s technical work. These were shared with
member countries at the APRC and include:
1.

Shifting demographic structures in rural communities, along with migration, feminization
of agriculture, and aging of the rural population
Migration is increasing in many Asian countries. In some cases, especially in South
Asia, it is predominantly men who migrate from rural communities, leaving women in
charge of managing farms and households and resulting in a feminization of agriculture.
For example, in Nepal, the share of female agricultural employment went from 35
percent in 1980 to about 50 percent in 2010 (Slavchevska, Kaaria and Taivalmaa, 2016).
The female share of the agricultural labour force has also increased dramatically in Pakistan,
where it is now almost triple the rate in 1980, and in Bangladesh where it now exceeds 50
percent (FAO, 2011b). This phenomenon creates opportunities, but also challenges for
the women who stay on the farm. Women may take on new tasks and have more say in
the household or farm; but also need more training and services and face additional work
and time burdens. Migration changes the demographic structure of rural communities
and can lead to labour shortages, since working-age people are more likely to migrate,
leaving elders and young children behind. As a result, older people, particularly older
women, must take on more work.

2.

Changing agri-food systems, mechanization of production, and commercialization of
agriculture
The Asia-Pacific region is home to 70 percent of the world’s family farmers, most of
whom operate small-scale farms (FAO, 2016b). Across Asia and the Pacific the trend is to
wards increasing mechanization and commercialization of agricultural production.
New mechanized production models and market-linked value chains present opportunities for
farmers to expand existing farming operations and access paid labour. However, some
farmers, particularly those with the smallest holdings, the land-poor, and the landless,
are at risk of being displaced by larger operations and may be disadvantaged in accessing
markets and contracts. Women in particular may lose control of productive activities
they once dominated such as, for example, small livestock production (Doss, 2011).
Commercial production may increase household in come overall, but can potentially
change the share of income women control in the household, or affect household
nutrition, if it displaces food crops previously grown by women.

3.

Climate change, extreme weather and environmental degradation
Climate change and associated phenomena threaten rural populations throughout the
region with changing temperatures and precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and
increased vulnerability to natural disasters. These in turn affect food availability,
livelihoods, assets, and health and may have far reaching social impacts. Women and
men will be affected by and respond differently to the challenges of climate change.
How gender roles and relations impact resilience building programmes, disaster
preparedness and livelihood restoration initiatives will be different in different
environmental and social contexts, but effectively analysing these and engaging
women and men is important to ensure the effectiveness of these programmes.
Additionally, environmental degradation may also increase women’s work by making
access to water and/or fuel more difficult, time consuming, or more costly. Access to
gender-responsive technologies and modern energy sources reduce health and
safety problems associated with energy acquisition and use (SE4All, 2015) and can
reduce the time women must work as well as the burden of that work.

4.

Widening income disparity and social inequalities
The benefits of economic growth, especially in fast growing economies, are not evenly
distributed. The rural poor, ethnic minorities, some castes, indigenous peoples, and
other marginalized groups are at risk of becoming even further marginalized by uneven
growth. Women – especially those in female-headed households – and ethnic minorities
are more vulnerable to shocks, such as price volatility and decreased food availability.
As income disparity and social inequalities worsen in the region and traditional rural
safety net systems are disrupted by migration and demographic shifts, providing social
protection measures becomes more important.

These trends will be further shaped by increased globalization, trade liberalization and
agreements, and regional collaboration. Specifically, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Economic Community integration will change labour markets, trade, migration and governance,
with the potential for both negative and positive impacts on gender equality.

3. Regional priorities, priority programmes and gender equality
The APRC identified regional priorities for the FAO work in support of member countries
in Asia and the Pacific. The primary mechanisms for addressing these priorities are the
Country Programming Frameworks (CPF) and the Regional Initiatives under the various Strategic
Programmes (SP). The main priorities are:

6

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

1.

Addressing hunger and malnutrition
The Zero Hunger Challenge (ZHC) addresses this priority by supporting national food
security policies, strengthening data collection and analysis, and promoting
nutrition-sensitive interventions. As key producers, procurers and primary preparers of
food and those most closely involved with child nutrition, women play a key role in
nutrition and food security. The Zero Hunger delivery team has identified raising
awareness of gender equality with key decision-makers and supporting the engagement
of organizations that support gender equality in the formulation of national
nutrition policies as ways to address gender equality within the initiative and more
broadly.

2.

Supporting rural livelihoods through increasing efficiency and yield of rice production
The Regional Rice Initiative (RRI) aims to improve the sustainability of rice production
by promoting more productive and sustainable rice production practices, supporting
farmer field schools, and policy processes such as the formulation and implementation
of national rice strategies. The RRI contributes to RAP’s broader Regional Rice Strategy.
The important role of women in rice production has been well documented.
The Regional Rice Strategy identifies several ways in which the role of women in rice
production can be supported to achieve more sustainable and efficient production,
including training women for new tasks and jobs and introducing mechanization and
practices to reduce the burden of women’s work.

3.

Sustainable intensification of aquaculture and fisheries
The Blue Growth Regional Initiative (BGRI) aims to increase the resilience of farmers
and fishers through inclusive aquaculture and fisheries value chains and by improving
access to quality production inputs, technologies and markets. Women play important roles
in aquaculture and, in some places, fishing production and value chains. However, not
enough information and data is available on women’s contributions within aquaculture,
fisheries and related value chains and how programming in these areas can best support
women’s economic empowerment (WEE). Knowledge generation and strengthened
gender analysis prior to designing interventions can support better integration of gender
concerns and identification of entry points for WEE in aquaculture and fisheries value
chains.

4.

Developing inclusive local value chains for food security and nutrition
Several country-level programmes address value chains, including gender-inclusive
value chains. The Regional Initiative for Developing Value Chains for Food Security and
Nutrition in the Pacific Islands seeks to achieve greater food security and improved
livelihoods by supporting the transition of semi-subsistence farmers into more

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

7

commercial production by improving access to markets. Developing regional policies and
institutions that encourage agribusiness development as well as creating an enabling
environment at the country level would help improve access to markets. Women in the
Pacific are active in many value chains, including production and marketing of produce
and tourism. However, they face barriers to market access, including discrimination
and social customs, mobility constraints, and lack of networks or capital. To ensure equality
and inclusiveness, it is important to address gender concerns in value chains both at the
policy level as well as in local-level programming.
5.

Data and analysis for decision-making
Increasing the availability of data and analysis for decision-makers to formulation effective
policies and programmes is a regional priority that cuts across RAP’s programming.
Data on the status of women and their roles in agriculture and rural economies in the
region are fragmented and not systematically collected. This, in turn, encourages the
use of inaccurate data and by and large creates missed opportunities for accurate
measurement of change and evidence-based programming and policies.6 In many sectors,
for example, fisheries and aquaculture, data are limited and rarely disaggregated by
sex (FAO, 2012). When official statistics do provide sex-disaggregated data, they often
undercount the participation of women in the labour force by considering some
activities – for instance onshore fishing net preparation and mending tasks – as domestic
work instead of productive work. Data are needed on the importance of the contributions
of both women and men to local economies and production systems and the different
roles and needs of men and women. FAO can support the collection, analysis and use of
sex-disaggregated data as well as supporting increased national capacity for gender-sensitive
monitoring and evaluation (M&E), particularly in relation to the implementation of the
2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. A key component in this effort is work to increase
awareness, especially among government counterparts, of the gender dimension
in the formulation, implementation, and M&E of plans, programmes and projects.

4. Priority Programmes
Two major multi-disciplinary priority programmes, which will be a focus of RAP’s efforts in the
upcoming four years, are currently in the planning and development stage. These programmes
will address many of the regional priorities above. They are:
1.

Scaling-up action on climate change and agriculture
Planning is underway at RAP for a cross-disciplinary effort to develop and implement a
regional programme to support member countries in addressing the 2030 Agenda on

8

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

climate change and food security through climate finance. In order to contribute to
efforts to address the drivers and impacts of climate change, countries developed Intended
Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), identifying actions to scale-up adaptation
and enhance the productivity and resilience of agricultural systems. 7 Assessing
vulnerabilities, coping strategies and adaptation from a gender perspective is an integral
part of adaptation plans and resilience building. If structural constraints that hamper women’s
access to resources, knowledge, technologies and services are removed, their full potential
as “agents of change” in climate change adaptation can be harnessed. 8 Resilience building
efforts that do not take into account gender differences risk having limited impact
and sustainability.
2.

One Health
One Health will address food systems and trade, enhancing the overall health of humans,
animals, plants and the environment and fostering economic development through
food safety and trade. 9
In the period 2017–2019, One Health will aim to increase food security and reduce public
health as well as animal and plant disease risks by understanding the drivers and risks,
developing and implementing risk mitigation policies, building capacity, ensuring
preparedness, and facilitating partnerships and coordination. Given women’s key role in
food systems – from food production, sales and procurement, as well as food
preparation and distribution – and in animal rearing, integrating a gender perspective
into the programme will be key to enhancing its potential to scale up and have a serious
impact on the lives of women and men, as well as their rural communities.

RAP focus areas for gender equality and women’s
empowerment
For the time period 2017–2019, RAP has identified four focus areas for work on gender. The
selected areas are those where: 1) there is recognized need for action, drawing on regional
priorities identified above; 2) RAP has the opportunity to make a significant contribution to
gender equality; and 3) RAP can build on work it has already started, to speed up progress and
achieve the desired impact within this time period. These focus areas were developed taking
into consideration the regional priorities as well as countries’ recognized gender needs.10

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

9

Cumulatively, the focus areas aim to: 1) improve RAP’s institutional capacity to promote gender
equality and implement programming that supports gender equality; 2) support the capacity
of partner organizations to implement inclusive rural development that serves women more
equitably; and 3) increase the number of women reached by the overall equity outcomes of
FAO programming in Asia-Pacific.

1. Developing improved understanding of gender dynamics
in changing agri-food systems
The regional trends identified above will affect men and women differently and may lead
to changes in social and gender roles. Understanding who will benefit from these changes and
who is at risk of being left behind is critical for sustainable and inclusive growth. In particular,
there is a need to understand how different women and men 11 will be differentially impacted
by change; how gender roles are changing in production and value chains; and how to mitigate
the risks faced by women and men. RAP can make a strategic contribution not only to its
own programming but to that of counterparts and other agencies by providing an up-to-date
understanding of how these emerging trends will affect different groups, including women in
different socioeconomic and ethnic groups.12
To strengthen understanding of the gender impacts of ongoing regional change, RAP will include
analysis of the impact of change on gender equality and rural women’s empowerment in its
upcoming analysis of the impact of key regional trends on agriculture and food security. Focus
will be placed on the implications for gender roles, the differential impact the changes will
have on men and women and new entry points for supporting men and women’s production
and well-being. The knowledge generated will be used to make the programmes of FAO and its
counterparts more responsive and effective and to increase their benefit to women and men.
Expected outputs
For the regional analysis, RAP will: 1) formulate the specific areas of information around
regional trends and gender equality, which are needed to support the work of FAO technical
staff and counterparts; 2) draft a report on key results and findings; 3) disseminate results
and findings as widely as possible to FAO technical staff, other UN agencies and organizations,
and member-country counterparts; 4) identify key areas linked to RAP programming where
more research might be needed; and 5) explore opportunities for systematising and analysing
existing information and data. Expanded awareness, knowledge and use of findings in FAO
and counterpart programmes in different technical areas are the longer-term outputs.

10

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

Implementing modalities and responsibilities
This work will be coordinated primarily through the RAP ADG/RR, Strategic Programme
Coordinator and Strategic Advisor. Other staff and counterparts, such as country office
staff, GFPs and technical staff in the identified priority areas will contribute as necessary.
Technical and programme staff in the technical areas covered will be responsible for using
the results to better support gender equality within their programmes, as well as developing
gender-sensitive M&E.

2. Increasing the benefits that women and men receive from
FAO and partner programmes in key productive systems,
including rice farming, fisheries and aquaculture
RAP will build and share knowledge on the gender dimension of key production and value
chain systems, particularly aquaculture and fisheries and rice, and identify key areas that could
contribute to WEE. To effectively implement aquaculture programmes, information is needed on
how gender inequalities, roles, and relations impact the production, distribution and marketing
of fish products, the gender division of labour and entry-points for women and men throughout
the value chain. More research has been done into the gender dimensions of rice production
and the Regional Rice Strategy provides some recommendations on reaching women farmers
via rice programming. However, work is still needed to adopt findings on gender into ongoing
programming.
The purpose of these efforts will be to improve the ability of aquaculture and fisheries, rice,
and mixed rice/aquaculture programming to benefit both women and men via the BGRI and
RRI country-level programmes.
Expected outputs
Work on expanding understanding of the gender dimension of aquaculture will be carried
out through: 1) a study of WEE in aquaculture in two countries (Indonesia and Bangladesh),
which is already underway and uses a case-study methodology; 2) a comparative study on the
gender equality dimensions of rice-shrimp and rice-rice farming systems in Vietnam;
3) a planned study to support the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines on Sustainable
Small-Scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security in Myanmar; 4) dissemination of results
of data collection and analysis within FAO and its partners; and 5) networking on gender in
aquaculture and fisheries at events such as the Global Symposium on Gender in Aquaculture
and Fisheries. Together, these activities contribute to strengthening the gender dimension in
country-level programmes and the BGRI.

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

11

In rice programming, the RRI will consider the recommendations contained in the Rice
Strategy and other ways to support women’s participation, including country studies to document
women’s contribution to rice systems, and the promotion of rice and aquaculture-based
labour-saving technologies and practices that are suitable for women. For programming in both
areas, gender-sensitive M&E should be used to monitor women and men’s participation in the
programme, including the benefits the programme delivers.
Implementing modalities and responsibilities
The regional gender team, in collaboration with technical staff in fisheries and aquaculture, will
be responsible for moving this work forward, with the collaboration of staff working on relevant
programmes. The headquarters-based gender team and fisheries team will collaborate in the
process. Technical and programme staff involved in aquaculture and the BGRI will be responsible
for using the results.
Technical staff and programme staff contributing to the RRI and under SP2, 3 and 4 will identify
ways in which existing programmes can promote gender equality and women’s empowerment,
including through gender-sensitive M&E so that gender differentiated results can be reported.

3. Advancing gender equality in food and nutrition security
programming
In nutrition and food security policies and programming (e.g. the Zero Hunger Initiative and
related networks), FAO will raise awareness and promote gender equality, particularly in
areas related to nutrition-sensitive agriculture, food loss and food waste, nutrition-sensitive
social protection and women’s work burden.
Expected outputs
Within the ZHC, RAP will raise awareness of gender equality, including within the context of the
joint SP1-SP3 nutrition-sensitive social protection and nutrition-sensitive agriculture initiatives.
A regional social protection workshop and training for nutrition focal points are already planned
under these initiatives where gender equality dimensions in nutrition and food security will
be addressed. At the country level, contribution to this focus area will come from the “Role of
Women in Reducing Food Waste and Food Losses” project, planned under the 2016–2020 CPF of
Indonesia and a planned study in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic on the linkages between
nutrition interventions, women’s work burden and social protection measures.

12

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

Implementing modalities and responsibilities
The ZHC team together with the SP1 staff will be responsible for identifying opportunities to
mainstream gender equality in policies and programmes, liaising with technical and programme
staff in different locations. SP1 and SP3 teams will be responsible for the refinement and
implementation of the activities under the joint nutrition-sensitive social protection programme.
Indonesia and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic country office staff, together with technical
officers in RAP and headquarters, will be responsible for the formulation of the above-mentioned
project and study.

4. Improving protection from and resilience to disasters and
climate change risks for women and men
The Asia-Pacific region is prone to disasters, extreme weather events and the effects of climate
change. RAP and country offices will strengthen efforts to support building the resilience of
women and men to face the effects of climate change and disasters, including through the
promotion of gender mainstreaming in policies and programmes, gender analysis and planning,
and gender-responsive social protection measures. Women can play a key role as “agents of
change” in climate change adaptation thanks to their knowledge and expertise on natural
resource management and their capacity to engage in innovative and sustainable agricultural
practices.13 RAP will work on strengthening the institutional and technical capacity to address
gender concerns in climate change policies and programmes and women’s resilience, including
through the promotion and adoption of gender-responsive, climate-smart agricultural practices
and technologies. In terms of disaster preparedness, women face different risks and problems
(e.g. not being able to swim, having less access to information, being responsible for children
and the elderly) than men and may be differently impacted by the effects of disasters and
climate change.14 When programming in this area, RAP will strengthen systematic integration
of gender analysis, mainstreaming and gender-sensitive monitoring and reporting.
Expected outputs
The design for new and ongoing resilience building efforts and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and
disaster recovery programmes will address gender concerns to ensure that interventions are
more inclusive of both women and men and of marginalized groups. RAP will proactively seek
opportunities to promote women’s empowerment and an enhanced role in the restoration of
livelihoods in areas affected by disasters, including through the development of value-adding
initiatives, marketing and entrepreneurship. These initiatives may also apply to livelihood
restoration programmes following conflicts and man-made disasters. Gender-sensitive M&E
will be used to report results for women and men. Through the work under the Climate Change

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

13

regional programme, efforts will be made to integrate a gender perspective in National
Adaptation Plans and in the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by
promoting systematic use of gender analysis, gender mainstreaming and gender indicators.
In RAP programming is already ongoing that will contribute to gender equality and women’s
empowerment for climate change adaptation and poverty reduction. At the country level,
a gender- sensitive DRR policy is included in the 2016-2020 CPF of Indonesia.
Implementing modalities and responsibilities
Regional and country staff working in DRR and under SP5 will be responsible for conducting
gender analyses and identifying ways to make programmes more gender responsive, as well
as implementing gender-sensitive M&E.
RAP technical staff will be responsible for efforts to mainstream gender equality in the
development and implementation of the Climate Change regional programme and climate
change related initiatives, including projects under the Global Environment Facility and Green
Climate Fund.
The RAP gender team and technical staff will be responsible for raising awareness about the
need to strengthen women’s resilience to climate change and poverty.

Improving intervention effectiveness: mainstreaming
gender in projects, planning and M&E
In addition to the focus areas above, RAP will continue to strengthen its institutional capacity
to mainstream gender, build on the work already started to mainstream gender through its
technical areas and programmes, include gender in strategic planning at the country level and
develop gender-sensitive M&E.
Strengthening RAP’s institutional ability to mainstream gender. RAP will strengthen the
institutional capacity for mainstreaming by continuing to develop the GFP network. Almost
all RAP countries have GFPs in place and many also have government counterparts acting as
GGFPs. RAP will provide GFPs with additional training in gender issues and gender mainstreaming.
A regional stocktaking exercise indicated their need for additional training and support to
implement their work.15 This will serve to ensure gender work throughout the region is
coordinated and carried out in line with the FAO GEP.

14

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

Continued mainstreaming throughout RAP’s portfolio. Technical teams within RAP will continue
to expand their work mainstreaming gender equality into programmes in agriculture, rural and
social development, livestock, forestry, fisheries, land and water and value chain programming.
A few selected areas where work has been ongoing or planned are indicated below:
•
		
		
		
		
		

Forestry: RAP will build on knowledge developed through a regional assessment and
eight country assessments on mainstreaming gender in forestry in Asia and the Pacific,
development of a training manual, and regional capacity development workshops in
Rotorua and Bangkok. In the up-coming period, RAP will work towards promoting
capacity development activities and knowledge sharing on gender and forestry
throughout the region.

•
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

Land tenure and natural resource governance: RAP will deepen efforts to promote
equality in women’s access to land and participation in natural resource governance.
RAP plans to scale up the FAO Capacity Development Programme on Gender and the
Voluntary Guidelines for the Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forestry
(VGGT), which supports human and institutional capacity development in gender
sensitive land tenure governance and the implementation of the VGGTs at national
level. This programme has been implemented in Mongolia and will be rolled out in
Nepal and other countries. In addition, studies are planned in Cambodia and Myanmar
on customary tenure and women’s land rights.

•
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

Gender analysis and policy: RAP will continue to promote gender analysis and
mainstreaming as fundamental to ensuring gender equity, inclusiveness and
effectiveness. RAP will pilot the Gender in Agriculture Policies Assessment Tool in
countries where RAP already collaborates with governments on gender issues, such as
Cambodia, Bangladesh, and Nepal. This toolkit assists government and other stakeholders
to carry out a participatory process of diagnosis, analysis and reflection on gender
equality gaps in policies and implementation with a view towards outlining concrete
policy steps to address those gaps.

Gender in strategic planning at the country level. Including gender in the CFPs is the key mechanism through which gender will be mainstreamed into country-level strategic planning. To start,
country gender assessments will be done in five countries (Myanmar, Cambodia, Papua New
Guinea, Nepal and Bhutan) where the process is already ongoing or planned and resources are
available. This will support the GEP and RAP’s regional strategy priorities as well as advance
member countries’ efforts to promote gender equality and rural women’s empowerment.
Knowledge generated under this area will inform programme design in key areas of the FAO
mandate in sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition security, natural resource management

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

15

and inclusive rural development. This will in turn enable more effective programming and help
RAP to reach out and benefit women and men equally.
Gender–sensitive M&E and reporting. Gender sensitive M&E and reporting are critical not
only to be able to measure that programmes are benefitting women equally, but also to
continue learning which approaches work. One needed step is to improve the gender content
of annual reports, which currently is not systematic. Also, improvement is needed in the ability
to track gender in the country and regional level programme portfolios. A second area of work
is strengthening the gender sensitivity of project design, M&E and reporting by conducting
gender analysis in programme and project design, including gender equality in objectives, and
collecting sex-disaggregated data on participation and impact.
Expected outputs
To develop the capacity of GFPs and relevant staff, RAP will undertake: 1) systematic briefings
for new FAO Representatives, Assistant FAO Representatives and GFPs; 2) organization of RAP
training, particularly online webinars, with key topics including the FAO GEP and knowledge
of mechanisms and tools for gender mainstreaming; 3) systematic sharing of guidelines and
tools developed by headquarters; and 4) development, sharing and training on the use of
country level M&E tools to enhance reporting capacity. In addition, RAP will support the GFPs
to develop their work plans in alignment with the regional strategy and to raise funds locally
for specific activities.
Gender will be included in plans to support countries in meeting the SDGs. Programming and
projects will contribute to gender equality by considering gender roles in programme design and
implementation; undertaking programmes which explicitly address women’s as well as men’s
needs; supporting the equal access of women and men to resources, training, information and
services; working with organizations that promote gender equality; and supporting women
and men’s equal participation in rural institutions.
Gender will be considered in strategic planning processes at regional and country level and all
new CPFs will include gender discussions. Gender assessments will be conducted in the five
countries mentioned above.
New systems and recommendations for reporting developed by headquarters will be promoted
and adopted and project-level gender-sensitive M&E will be strengthened within the identified
focus areas so that results can be measured and used to identify lessons learned. In addition,
RAP will support raising awareness and capacity development of country office staff and key
stakeholders focusing on the importance of gender equality data in order to support countries’
efforts to develop indicators for the SDGs and to implement the 2030 Agenda.

are: 1) contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition; 2) increase

and improve provision of goods and services from agriculture, forestry and fisheries in a
sustainable manner; 3) reduce rural poverty; 4) enable more inclusive and efficient agricultural
and food systems at local, national and international levels; and 5) increase the resilience of livelihoods
to threats and crises.

Malaysia, 7-11 March 2016.
4 The Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index is composed of two sub-indexes: the five domains of

empowerment index and the gender parity index. The former measures five domains of empowerment:
1) production decision-making; 2) access to decision-making power over productive resources;
3) control over use of income; 4) leadership; and 5) time allocation. The latter (GPI) measures women’s
empowerment relative to men in the same household (IFPRI, 2014). The baseline report covered 19
countries with the following 3 countries in RAP: Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia.

Gender is only one of the social dimensions that creates differential positions and access to

opportunities. Therefore it is important to adopt an intersectionality approach that takes into account
how gender intersects with other social differences – age, ethnicity, class, etc.
12

This strategy promotes an intersectional approach to gender, taking into account to the extent

possible the ways gender interacts with other social differences such as age, ethnicity, religion, class, etc.

REGIONAL GENDER STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2017–2019 for Asia and the Pacific

According to a survey by Oxfam, four times as many women than men were killed in the 2004
Indian Ocean tsunami-affected areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and India. Women died because they
stayed behind to look for their children and other relatives. Also, women often cannot swim and climb
trees, which meant they could not escape. For example, in Sri Lanka, swimming and climbing trees
are mainly taught to boys, and this allowed more males to survive during the tsunami. Oxfam. 2005. The
tsunami’s impact on women, available at http://www.preventionweb.net/files/1502_bn050326

According to the RAP gender stocktaking, many GFPs and GGFPs have not had capacity building in
gender, or do not feel they have high levels of skills in all areas. Capacity development is particularly
FAO gender policy, gender in program design, and gender-sensitive M&E.
